    "# Knowing your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of environments that you need to consider when developing code.\n",
    "The `bash` environment which knows about the shell and your OS, and the `python` environment which knows about the python packages you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bash environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash environment is defined by a set of environment variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a key-value pair, stored by the OS, used by programs and shell scripts to configure the system behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is the variable name, and the value is the variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set an environment variable, you can use the `export` command. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export MY_VARIABLE=\"my_value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the value of an environment variable, you can use the `echo` command. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo $MY_VARIABLE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with the dollar sign `$` to get the value of the variable (think of dollar/value).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can list the environment variables currently set in your bash session by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "printenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two commands do exactly the same. They are **very important**, you should not forget about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:**  Connect to CSD3 and list the environment variables.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main environment variables you need to know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PATH`: Defines the directories where the system searches for executable programs. It's essential for adding research software tools like compilers, or compiled programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** On your local machine list the executables found in some of the directories in your `PATH`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS): Used to specify additional directories where the system looks for shared libraries (.so or .dylib files). For example, such librairies can be math libraries (e.g., [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK), [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS), [FFTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFTW), [GSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Scientific_Library), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the `LD` stands for \"Linker/Loader\". It refers to the **dynamic linker or dynamic loader**, which is the part of the operating system responsible for loading shared libraries (also known as dynamic libraries) when an executable program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HOME`: Your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `USER`: Holds your username.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PYTHONPATH`: Used to specify additional directories where the system looks for Python packages. Typically, where the systems look when you run `import ...` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Open a Colab notebook and print the values of each of these environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use the `!` to run the bash commands in Colab.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding to your `PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add to your `PATH` by appending the directory to the `PATH` variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=/path/to/your/program:$PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also prepend to your `PATH` by adding the directory at the beginning of the `PATH` variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The order in which you add directories to your `PATH` is important. The first directory in the `PATH` is the first one that is searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Add a directory to your `PATH` and check that it works. If you have a directory that contains an executable, add this one and try running the program from anywhere in the system.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding to your path variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add to any path variables in exactly the same way as we have seen for `PATH` above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to add a directory to your `PYTHONPATH`, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/program:$PYTHONPATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making the changes persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make the changes persistent by adding them to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS) file. For example, to add a directory to your `PATH`, you can type in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"export PATH=/path/to/your/program:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then reload the `~/.bashrc` file by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so the changes are applied in your current shell as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a fake directory to your `PATH`. For instance `/path/to/nowhere`, using the `export` command.\n",
    "2. Use echo to check the `PATH` has been updated.\n",
    "3. Close your current shell (i.e., Terminal) and re-open it (or open a new one).\n",
    "4. Check the `PATH` and note that the fake path is not there.\n",
    "5. Redo 1-4 but this time modify the `~/.bashrc` file to make the change persistent before step 3.\n",
    "6. Check that the change is persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To undo the change, remove the new line added to the `~/.bashrc` file. Use vim or VS code to do so. \n",
    "</div>\n",

    "## Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was invented in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at  the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (abbr. CWI; English: \"National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science\") in the Netherlands.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages, for its widespread use in machine learning and data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The name Python comes from the British comedy group Monty Python. You will occasionnaly find some further references, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\". Python is fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "As researcher data scientists, your Python environment consists mainly of **three components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python interpreter/version,\n",
    "2. Virtual environment(s),\n",
    "3. Jupyter notebook and kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Python interpreter** is the program that **runs your Python code**. It is the interface between your code and the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (i.e., a Python interpreter) may not be natively installed on your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you type `python` in your terminal, and get an error such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash: python: command not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then you need to install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On MacOS** you can install Python (i.e., a Python interpreter) using Homebrew, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Linux** you can install Python using your package manager, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On CSD3** several Python interpreters are available. To load the one we need for this course, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load miniconda3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note for CSD3: if you don't use this command, Python won't be available to you. You need to type this command every time you start a new terminal and want to use Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then check the default python version you get by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then start a Python session by typing `python` in your terminal, you should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Python 3.11.9 (main, Sep 24 2024, 09:39:15) [GCC 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-22)] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` is the **Python prompt**. You can type Python code between the prompt and **press Enter to execute the code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit the Python interpreter, you can type `exit()` and press Enter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in a Python session, type `import platform; platform.python_implementation()` and press Enter. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "'CPython'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Python interpreter is **CPython**. This is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython#:~:text=CPython%20is%20the%20reference%20implementation,implementation%20of%20the%20Python%20language.)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Packages can have conflicts, and some software may require a specific version of a package. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python environment is a directory that contains a Python interpreter and a curated set of installed packages readily available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice is to create a new virtual environment for each project. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple tools to create and manage virtual environments. Here we use venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new virtual environment, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a directory to store the virtual environments, e.g., `venvs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir venvs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create the virtual environment in this directory, do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv <path/to/venvs/nameofenv>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `-m venv` specifies that we use the `venv` module to create a virtual environment. The `-m` option tells Python to run the `venv` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<path/to/venvs/nameofenv>` is the path to the directory where the virtual environment will be created, and `nameofenv` is the name of the virtual environment. Just above, we have created the directory `venvs`. We can use any name for the virtual environment, e.g., `venv_lecture2` or anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "source <path/to/venvs/nameofenv/bin/activate>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Terminal, you should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(nameofenv) <your-prompt>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you run the command `pip list`, you will see the packages currently installed in your virtual environment. This should be different from the packages installed in your *global* Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the following command in the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
