    "# Knowing your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of environments that you need to consider when developing code.\n",
    "The `bash` environment which knows about the shell and your OS, and the `python` environment which knows about the python packages you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bash environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash environment is defined by a set of environment variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a key-value pair, stored by the OS, used by programs and shell scripts to configure the system behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is the variable name, and the value is the variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set an environment variable, you can use the `export` command. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export MY_VARIABLE=\"my_value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the value of an environment variable, you can use the `echo` command. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo $MY_VARIABLE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with the dollar sign `$` to get the value of the variable (think of dollar/value).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can list the environment variables currently set in your bash session by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "printenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two commands do exactly the same. They are **very important**, you should not forget about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:**  Connect to CSD3 and list the environment variables.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main environment variables you need to know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PATH`: Defines the directories where the system searches for executable programs. It's essential for adding research software tools like compilers, or compiled programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** On your local machine list the executables found in some of the directories in your `PATH`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS): Used to specify additional directories where the system looks for shared libraries (.so or .dylib files). For example, such librairies can be math libraries (e.g., [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK), [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS), [FFTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFTW), [GSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Scientific_Library), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the `LD` stands for \"Linker/Loader\". It refers to the **dynamic linker or dynamic loader**, which is the part of the operating system responsible for loading shared libraries (also known as dynamic libraries) when an executable program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HOME`: Your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `USER`: Holds your username.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PYTHONPATH`: Used to specify additional directories where the system looks for Python packages. Typically, where the systems look when you run `import ...` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Open a Colab notebook and print the values of each of these environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use the `!` to run the bash commands in Colab.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding to your `PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add to your `PATH` by appending the directory to the `PATH` variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=/path/to/your/program:$PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also prepend to your `PATH` by adding the directory at the beginning of the `PATH` variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The order in which you add directories to your `PATH` is important. The first directory in the `PATH` is the first one that is searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Add a directory to your `PATH` and check that it works. If you have a directory that contains an executable, add this one and try running the program from anywhere in the system.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding to your path variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add to any path variables in exactly the same way as we have seen for `PATH` above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to add a directory to your `PYTHONPATH`, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/program:$PYTHONPATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making the changes persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make the changes persistent by adding them to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS) file. For example, to add a directory to your `PATH`, you can type in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"export PATH=/path/to/your/program:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then reload the `~/.bashrc` file by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so the changes are applied in your current shell as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a fake directory to your `PATH`. For instance `/path/to/nowhere`, using the `export` command.\n",
    "2. Use echo to check the `PATH` has been updated.\n",
    "3. Close your current shell (i.e., Terminal) and re-open it (or open a new one).\n",
    "4. Check the `PATH` and note that the fake path is not there.\n",
    "5. Redo 1-4 but this time modify the `~/.bashrc` file to make the change persistent before step 3.\n",
    "6. Check that the change is persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To undo the change, remove the new line added to the `~/.bashrc` file. Use vim or VS code to do so. \n",
    "</div>\n",
