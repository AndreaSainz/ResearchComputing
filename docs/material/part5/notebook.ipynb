    "# Distributing your package\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the process we continue using the `company_package` that we developed in \n",
    "[part 4](../part4/notebook.html#Working-example).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, the code of your package should be developed with `git` and uploaded on GitHub \n",
    "(or GitLab, or Bitbucket, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to keep your code private you can of course do so, while developing it and sharing it with your chosen colleagues by inviting them to your private repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will assume your are ready to share your code with the world and \n",
    "that you want it to be usable by users on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Source and wheels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we used \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "inside our `company_package` folder, we created a sub-folder called `company.egg-info`, which contains metadata about the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Look inside the `company.egg-info` folder and check-out the content of the files there. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, we also automatically created a new folder called `dist-info` inside our environment site-packages folder, which contains the same sort of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder will typically be at \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<venvdir>/<name-of-env>/lib/python3.X/site-packages/company-<version>.dist-info\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Look inside the `dist-info` folder of your site-packages folder and check-out the content of the files there. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the files is `direct_url.json`. In our case it shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"dir_info\": {\"editable\": true}, \"url\": \"file:///path/to/company_package\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which means we have installed the package in editable mode and the location of the **source code** is given by the `url` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have not **built** the package yet, i.e., we have not created a binary distribution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do it. To do so, in a Terminal we run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "from inside the package folder. At the end of the process, a `dist` folder should be created and we should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Successfully built company-0.0.0b1.dev6+gfa37a84.d20241029.tar.gz and company-0.0.0b1.dev6+gfa37a84.d20241029-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These two files, stored in the `dist` folder, are the source distribution and the wheel distribution of the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wheel distribution is a binary distribution of the package. (In fact, for a pure Python package, it amounts  to an archive of the package efficiently organized. For a package with compiled extensions, it also contains the compiled files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing from the wheel can be much faster than from the source. To do so, we can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install <package-name>-<version>-<py-version>-<platform>.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(However, note that this is not allowing you to install the package in editable mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what's inside the wheel, we can extract it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "unzip <package-name>-<version>-<py-version>-<platform>.whl -d <where-to-extract>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Create, install and extract the wheel distribution of the `company` package and inspect its content.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building packages for multiple platforms and architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we notice that our wheel file says `py3-none-any`. This means that it is compatible with Python 3 (any version), \n",
    "and will work on any platform (macOS, Linux, Windows, etc.) and any architecture (x86, arm, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is generally the case for pure Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
