    "This course itself is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) using a [theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) provided by [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org). \n",

    "## What is automatic documentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is documentation generated automatically out of **docstrings** in your package code, as well as other metadata and documentation in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are comments typically placed under your function/class definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in the `base_company.py` file (see [here](https://github.com/borisbolliet/company_package/blob/main/company/base_company.py)): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def summarize_activity(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Summarizes company activities and additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        - *args: A list of activities related to the company.\n",
    "        - **kwargs: Additional information, like location or date.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every function/class in your package should have a docstring, and some functions can have more details, for instance\n",
    "including example on how to use the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in the `medical.py` file (see [here](https://github.com/borisbolliet/company_package/blob/main/company/medical/medical.py)): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def drug_approval_summary(self, dataset_path=None):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Prints a summary of drug approval attempts for the company's drugs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        - dataset_path (str): Path to the dataset with drug approval data.\n",
    "          If not provided, uses the default package data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            >>> medical_company = MedicalCompany(\"Pfizer\", \"Pharmaceuticals\", drug_manufacturer=True)\n",
    "            >>> medical_company.drug_approval_summary()\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Drug Approval Summary for Pfizer:\n",
    "             - Drug A: 2 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "             - Drug B: 0 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "             - Drug C: 1 failed attempt(s) before approval\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic documentation is then generated from these docstrings.\n",

    "## Sphinx\n",

    "[Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)) is a tool primarily used to create comprehensive and structured documentation for Python projects. It takes reStructuredText (reST) or Markdown files and generates clean, organized documentation in HTML, PDF, etc.\n",
